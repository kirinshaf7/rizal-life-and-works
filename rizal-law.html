                    <h3>Historical Context and Significance</h3>
                    <p>The Rizal Law was passed during a time when the Philippines was establishing its identity as an independent nation after gaining independence from the United States in 1946. The law faced significant opposition from the Catholic Church, which viewed Rizal's novels as anti-Catholic. Despite this opposition, Senator Recto and other nationalist legislators successfully pushed for the law's passage.</p>
                    
                    <p>The law's significance lies in its role in promoting Filipino nationalism and preserving the legacy of José Rizal. By mandating the study of Rizal's works, the law ensures that future generations of Filipinos understand the historical context of the Philippine revolution against Spanish colonialism and appreciate the intellectual contributions of the national hero.</p>

The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) has established guidelines for the content and delivery of these courses to ensure compliance with RA 1425.</p>
