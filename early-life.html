                        <div>
                            <h4>Physical Challenges</h4>
                            <p>Rizal was small in stature and physically frail as a child. To compensate, he took up physical exercise, including fencing, wrestling, and martial arts, developing discipline and determination.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Love for Learning</h4>
                            <p>From an early age, Rizal demonstrated an insatiable curiosity and love for learning. He was an avid reader who spent hours in his family's library.</p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div>
                            <h4>Sense of Justice</h4>
                            <p>Witnessing injustices, including his mother's wrongful imprisonment, instilled in Rizal a strong sense of justice and a desire to fight against oppression.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Religious Faith</h4>
                            <p>Rizal's deep religious faith, nurtured by his family and his education at the Ateneo, provided a moral foundation for his life while also making him critical of religious abuses.</p>

                            <strong>The GOMBURZA Execution:</strong> 
                            <p>The execution of three Filipino priests (Gomez, Burgos, and Zamora) in 1872 had a profound impact on the 11-year-old Rizal, awakening his awareness of the injustices of Spanish colonial rule.</p>

                            <p>The harassment experienced by his family, including his mother's imprisonment and the constant threat of eviction from their lands, made Rizal acutely aware of the abuses of the colonial system.</p>
