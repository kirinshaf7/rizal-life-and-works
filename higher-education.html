                            <p>Rizal experienced discrimination as a Filipino student. Spanish professors and Dominican friars who ran the university often favored Spanish students over native Filipinos.</p>

                    <p>In May 1882, Rizal secretly left the Philippines for Spain, without informing Spanish authorities who might have prevented his departure. This journey marked the beginning of a decade of travel, study, and intellectual growth across Europe.</p>

                            <p>Rizal immersed himself in European culture, visiting museums, attending operas and plays, and studying European art and architecture. These experiences broadened his worldview and influenced his own artistic work.</p>

                            <p>Despite coming from a relatively wealthy family, Rizal often faced financial difficulties during his time in Europe.
